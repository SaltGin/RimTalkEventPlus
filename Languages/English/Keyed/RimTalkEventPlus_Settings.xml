  <RimTalkEventPlus_EnableCompression_Label>Enable event text compression (WIP - coming soon, toggle currently does nothing)</RimTalkEventPlus_EnableCompression_Label>

  <RimTalkEventPlus_EnableCompression_Tooltip>Use compressed event text to reduce token usage when sending quests and events to RimTalk.</RimTalkEventPlus_EnableCompression_Tooltip>

  <RimTalkEventPlus_Compression_Description>When enabled, Event+ will compress long, repetitive quest descriptions while keeping key facts.

Example (refugee hospitality quest):
- Before: A long multi-paragraph letter explaining who the refugees are, why they fled, how long they will stay, and that they will work and fight for free...
- After: A short summary like: "The colony accepted the refugees. They fled for [reason], will stay for X days to rest, and will work and fight for free during that time."

When disabled, Event+ always sends the full original event text.</RimTalkEventPlus_Compression_Description>
